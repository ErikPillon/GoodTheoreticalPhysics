# GoodTheoreticalPhysics
What is necessary for doing *good* theoretical physics?

Introduction
This is a fairly detailed collection of all the subjects, concepts, theorems and tools Iâ€™we studied during my educational
trip. There is no request of completeness as well as this "few" concepts must be intended as a leading guide for the
student that is approaching mathematics and/or physics from scratch.
