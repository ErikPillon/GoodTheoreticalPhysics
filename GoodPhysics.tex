\section*{Introduction}
This is a fairly detailed collection of all the subjects, concepts, theorems and tools I'we studied during my educational trip. There is no request of completeness as well as this "few" concepts must be intended as a leading guide for the student that is approaching mathematics and/or physics from scratch.

\section{Algebra}
Even if this (sometimes \emph{very}) abstract subject is considered almost selfcontained and useful only for very narrow fields purposes, I wanted to be very precises in the subsections in order to underline the extreme importance that Algebra and (Lie) Groups in general has assumed in the last few decades. The ones listed belows are nowaday unavoidable topics for future theoreticians willing to completely understand all the Symmetry Properties in Nature, from Special and General Relativity to Classical and Quantum Mechanics as well as Particle Physics. 
\subsection{Group Theory}

	\item Cayley Diagram
	\item Generators
	\item Klein Group
	\item Cyclic Group
	\item Abelian Group
	\item Dehydral Group
	\item Coset
	\item Normal Subgroup
	\item Quotient Group
	\item Semidirect Product
	\item Group Representation 
	\item Irreducible Group Class
\end{itemize}
\section{Geometry}
It is not uncommon today for a physicist's mathematical education to ignore all but the simplest geometrical ideas, despite the fact that young physicists are encouraged to develop mental 'pictures' and 'intuition' appropriate to physical phenomena.
This curious neglect of 'pictures' of one's mathematical tools may be seen as the
outcome of a gradual evolution over many centuries. Geometry was certainly
extremely important to ancient and medieval natural philosophers; it was in
geometrical terms that Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo all expressed
their thinking. But when Descartes introduced coordinates into Euclidean
geometry, he showed that the study of geometry could be regarded as an application of algrebra. Since then, the importance of the study of geometry in the education of scientists has steadily declined, so that at present a university undergraduate physicist or applied mathematician is not likely to encounter
much geometry at all.

One reason for this suggests itself immediately: the relatively simple geometry
of the three-dimensional Euclidean world that the nineteenth-century physicist
believed he lived in can be mastered quickly, while learning the great diversity of
analytic techniques that must be used to solve the differential equations of
physics makes very heavy demands on the student's time. Another reason must
surely be that these analytic techniques were developed at least partly in
response to the profound realization by physicists that the laws of nature could
be expressed as differential equations, and this led most mathematical physicists
genuinely to neglect geometry until relatively recently.

However, two developments in this century have markedly altered the balance
between geometry and analysis in the twentieth-century physicist's outloook.
The first is the development of the theory of relativity, according to which the
Euclidean three-space of the nineteenth-century physicist is only an approxi-
mation to the correct description of the physical world. The second development,
which is only beginning to have an impact, is the realization by twentieth-century mathematicians, led by Cartan, that the relation between geometry and analysis is a two-way street: on the one hand analysis may be the foundation of the study
of geometry, but on the other hand the study of geometry leads naturally to the
development of certain analytic tools (such as the Lie derivative and the exterior
calculus) and certain concepts (such as the manifold, the fiber bundle, and the
identification of vectors with derivatives) that have great power in applications
of analysis. In the modern view, geometry remains subsidiary to analysis. For
example, the basic concept of differential geometry, the differentiable manifold,
is defined in terms of real numbers and differentiable functions. But this is no
disadvantage: it means that concepts from analysis can be expressed geometri-
cally, and this has considerable heuristic power.

Because it has developed this intimate connection between geometrical and analytic ideas, modern differential geometry has become more and more important in theoretical physics, where it has led to a greater simplicity in the mathematics and a more fundamental understanding of the physics. This revolution has affected not only special and general relativity, the two theories whose content is most obviously geometrical, but other fields where the geometry involved is not always that of physical space but rather of a more abstract space of variables: electromagnetism, thermodynamics, Hamiltonian theory, fluid dynamics, and elementary particle physics.

\section{Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics}
Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics deals with the issue of microscopically modelling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat. Unlike with equilibrium, there is no exact formalism that applies to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in general, and so this branch of statistical mechanics remains an active area of theoretical research.
